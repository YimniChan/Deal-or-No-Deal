# Deal-or-No-Deal
This project is to create a java base Deal or No Deal game.<br/>
This game design is for a single player.<br/>
Player has to select one case out of twenty-six.<br/>
The game will have ten rounds.<br/>
Player has to remove a certain amount of cases based on the round number.<br/>
Each removed case will show the value inside.<br/>
The banker will make an offer when the player has finished the round based on the case values and number of cases left in play
Player decides “Deal, or no deal?”<br/>
To end the game, the player can keep his/her own case throughout the 10 rounds, or accept the banker’s offer.<br/>
